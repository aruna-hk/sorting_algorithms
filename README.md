SORTING ALGORITHMS

>> sorting is a was of rearranging elements in a data structure according to
 desired order, increasing, decreasing, alphabetical order , etc

>>> sorting algorithms have different run time and storage capabilities
therefor to determine the complexity of algorithm analysis should be done to construct 
its run time and memory used during run time, thus algorithms efficiency differs

>> popular sorting algorithms include , insertion sort, slection sort, merge sort and bubble sort
>>> description of the algorithms appear before the code in this repository, how they work
 as well as their time compleities in big on notation

>> algorithm complexity is fuction of time which take number of elements to be sorted

1:0-bubble_sort.c - bubble sort algorithm, functionality dscription of the file comment
    on the file
    demo - sortig array of integers in increasing order
        compile with 
		gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c print_array.c -o bubble
        run the program on cmdline "./bubble" - print array after every swap
